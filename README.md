To Do List app created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Live demo [here](https://mdesanker.github.io/todo-list/).

The 'todos' are objects created with classes. Each todo has a name and a due date proeprty. App has projects that can be used to categorize todos. User can create/delete projects, create/delete/mark complete todos and data is stored locally in the browser so that todos are saved.

Functionality with date-fns library has not been implemented yet so projects are not sorted into "Today" and "This week" projects. That is a next step for this project.

Learned:

- Practice with importing and exporting JavaScript modules
- More comfortable with classes
- Storing a class instance in local storage, recovering it as an object, and converting the data back into a class instance
- Practice with webpack to bundle files and manage website assets
